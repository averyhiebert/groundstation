# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (for Ubuntu)

sudo apt-get update

#If you want to use the entire system, start from here:
sudo apt-get install rtl-sdr           # Control sdr stick & demodulate signal

#If you want to test the decoder but don't care about demodulation,
# start from here:
sudo apt-get install direwolf          # Decode APRS

#If you don't want decoding OR demodulation,
# and just want to test the server, start here:

sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential # Install pip, if you don't have it already, to get python libraries.
